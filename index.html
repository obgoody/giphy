        <!-- Before you can make any part of our site work, 
        you need to create an array of strings, each one related to a topic that interests you. 
        Save it to a variable called topics. -->

        var topics = ["surfing","skateboarding","travel"];

        <!-- <!-- We chose animals for our theme, but you can make a list to your own liking.
        Your app should take the topics in this array and create buttons in your HTML. -->

        <!-- Try using a loop that appends a button for each string in the array.
        When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, 
        non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page. -->

        <!-- When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. 
        If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing. -->
        
        <!-- Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on). -->
        
        <!-- This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
        Only once you get images displaying with button presses should you move on to the next step.
        Add a form to your page takes the value from a user input box and adds it into your topics array. 
        Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array remakes the buttons on the page. -->
